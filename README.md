# Simplem
Minimal notepad-like markdown editor. To write down your amazing ideas immediately.

[日本語表示](https://github.com/isahamawan/Simplem/blob/master/README_JA.md)

## What is important when you come up with an idea?
One time I was eating dinner and watching TV when I suddenly had a good idea.

Unfortunately, while I was looking for a pen and paper to write it down, I forgot the important idea.

When you have an idea, it's important to write it down immediately with a pen and paper.

**"Simplem is a paper-and-pen-like app that you can launch as soon as you have an idea and write it down without worrying about it." **

### How?
- Launch it and you're up and running, no need for style or page setup!
- We've narrowed down the number of fonts. You can have fun choosing from a  unique fonts.
- We've made it simple to write in, just like the default notepad.
- You can also view diffs of your revisions.


## What's important when you're working on an idea?
When I was trying to come up with ideas for my work, I used to use a common word processor and think about this and that while writing.

However, as time went by, I began to worry about the size of the headings and the alignment of the text, and I became conscious of the need to make it neat.

Then it was too late, and I couldn't revise the text freely because I didn't want to ruin the clean headings and text alignment.

In this situation, even if I make a conscious effort to "write freely even if it destroys the neatness," my mind that wants to maintain the neatness gets in the way, and I can't write as I want.

**"Simplem is an app like a 'notepad in your head' that allows you to focus only on formulating ideas without thinking about 'neatness'." **

### How?
- You can use markdown notation, so you don't spend too much time obsessing over text modifiers
- While not spending too much time on modifiers, the headings and bolding are nice and neat, and help you organize your ideas.
- Markdown marks are not visible except when editing (live preview), so they do not interfere with reading.
- Unlike other markdown editors with live preview, the size of the text on the editing screen is consistent, so you can write freely and without worry.
	- If you think I'm lying, consider yourself fooled and compare your schedule for tomorrow with Simplem and other markdown editors.
- Table of contents and links are automatically created based on headings, so you can easily move back and forth in your document.
- Other innovations are being added daily to bring the "notepad in your head" to your computer!

## It's hard to rewrite the ideas you've put together!
It took me two hours to re-write the ideas that I had put together in my notepad in word software to show them to others.

It took me two hours to re-write the ideas I had in my notepad in Word to show them to others. It took me another two hours to create slides from the re-write to present to more people.

Have you ever experienced this? It happens a lot in my environment😂.

**"Simplem is an app that allows you to create a clarification and slides from a single idea note." **

### How?
- Markdown notation makes it moderately neat and tidy.
	- When printing or outputting PDFs, headings appear larger according to heading rank.
- Automatic page break at heading 1 (h1) when outputting (can be turned on/off in options)
- Page break at horizontal line (hr) when outputting (can be turned on/off in options)
- Click "Slides" button to edit as slides.
	- Page break with horizontal line (hr). You can also create a slide show.
- You can use html comment notation to write down your thoughts and ideas on the editing screen.
	- For example, the following comments will disappear in the output
		- `<! -- Great idea to write up in text later! -->`
